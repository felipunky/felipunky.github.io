    <h2>
        Bézier curves
    </h2>
    <p>
        Bézier curves are parametric curves resulting from parametric equations.
    </p>
    <p>
        Parametric equations express a set of quantities as explicit functions of a number of "parameters".
    </p>
    <p>
        A Bézier curve takes as input the coordinates in x and y, and z (3D case) plus the variable t (time it takes to traverse the curve), and outputs a new point (red dot).
    </p>
    <p>
        Case 1: A linear Bézier takes as input two points (A (magenta dot)
        and B (blue dot)) and outputs a new point W (red dot) (linear interpolation).
    </p>
    <p>
        The equation to get a third point C in the middle of A and B:
    </p>
    <p>
        W = 0.5A + 0.5B
    </p>
    <p>
        The parametric expression of C results in the graphing of the parametric curve at points (x, y) regarding various t's:
    </p>
    <p>
        W = ( 1 - t )A + tB
    </p>
    <p>
        Case 2: A Quadratic or 3rd degree Bézier results from extrapolating case 1, where a new control point C (cyan) is added, and the interpolation happens between A and B, and B and C. A further step of interpolation between the new points D and E (orange) result in the t parameter W (red dot).
    </p>
    <p>
        We could take what we learnt from the 2nd degree Bézier and apply it to higher degrees, but what we need is the interpolation of the interpolation of the interpolation.
    </p>
    <p>
        D = ( 1 - t )A + tB
    </p>
    <p>
        E = ( 1 - t )B + tC
    </p>
    <p>
        W = ( 1 - t )D + tE
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a system of equations, so we can substitute D and E directly into W without having to precompute them:
    </p>
    <p>
        W = ( 1 - t )[ ( 1 - t )A + tB ] + t[ ( 1 - t )B + tC ]
    </p>
    <p>
        W = ( 1 - t )^2A + 2( 1 - t )B + t^2C
    </p>
    <p>
        Case 3: Parametric Cubic or degree 4 Bézier curve, which extrapolates from the first and second cases, and it could be taken to higher degrees too.
    </p>
    <p>
        E = ( 1 - t )A + tB
    </p>
    <p>
        F = ( 1 - t )B + tC
    </p>
    <p>
        G = ( 1 - t )C + tD
    </p>
    <p>
        H = ( 1 - t )E + tF
    </p>
    <p>
        I = ( 1 - t )F + tG
    </p>
    <p>
        W = ( 1 - t )H + tI
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a system of equations, so we can substitute the previous interpolations into the last ones:
    </p>
    <p>
        W = ( 1 - t )[ ( 1 - t )( 1 - t )A + tB + ( 1 - t )B + tC ] + t[ ( 1 - t )( 1 - t )B + tC + ( 1 - t )C + tD ]
    </p>
    <p>
        That corresponds to:
    </p>
    <p>
        W = ( 1 - t )^3A + 3( 1 - t )^2tB + 3( 1 - t )t^2C + t^3D
    </p>
    <h3>
        Rational Bézier Curves
    </h3>
    <p>
        We could add another parameter called "weight" to the equations, which corresponds to the strength each t point is discretely pulled towards the control point.
        The equation reflects the transformed t parameter regarding both the calculations on the effect of weighted control points (control point * weight * t), and the
        parametrized (between 0 and 1) calculations amongst the weights and the parameter t (w * t), for each t being evaluated.
    </p>
    <p>
        W = ( 1 - t )Aw0 + tBw1 / ( 1 - t )w0 + tw1
    </p>
    <p>
        Higher degree (Quadratic):
    </p>
    <p>
        W = ( 1 - t )^2Aw0 + 2( 1 - t )Bw1 + t^2Cw2 / ( 1 - t )^2w0 + 2( 1 - t )w1 + t^2w2
    </p>
